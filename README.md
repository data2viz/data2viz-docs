# Data2viz documentation

Everything you need to know about the 
**[data2viz](https://github.com/data2viz/data2viz)** library.

## How the documentation is organized

A high-level overview of how it’s organized will help 
you know where to look for certain things:


### [Tutorials](tutorials/index.md)
Tutorials take you by the hand through a series of steps to 
create a datavisualization. Start here if you’re new to 
**data2viz**.

* [Let's make a JavaFX bar chart](tutorials/barchart-jfx/javafx-bar-chart.md)
* [Let's make a Kotlin/JS bar chart](tutorials/barchart-js/kotlinjs-bar-chart.md)


### [Topics](topics/index.md)
Topic guides discuss key topics and concepts at a fairly 
high level and provide useful background information and
 explanation.

* [API and DSL principles](topics/api-and-dsl.md)
* [Geo Projections](topics/geo.md) 

### [How-to guides](how-to/index.md)
How-to guides are recipes. They guide you through the steps 
involved in addressing key problems and use-cases. They 
are more advanced than tutorials and assume some knowledge 
of how **data2viz** works.

### [Reference](reference/index.md)
Reference guides contain technical reference for data2viz API. 
They describe how it works and how to use it but assume that you have 
a basic understanding of key concepts.
